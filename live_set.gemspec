    Live_set program can:
      - Make a copy of an Ableton Live 12 set and save to Live 11 format.
      - Report the version compatibility of an Ableton Live set.
      - Detect environmental problems, for example unwanted directories called Ableton Project Info in parent directories.
      - Display the location and size of the samples in each track.
      - Clearly show if a Live set is ready to be transferred to a Push 3 Standalone, and what needs to be changed if not.
        - Detect sets that are too large to be frozen, which means they are too large to transfer to Push 3 Standalone.
        - Detect tracks that are not frozen, which means they are not ready to be transferred to Push 3 Standalone.
        - Shows clips that are have not been collected within the setâ€™s project directory.

    Live_set has successfully converted the Ableton Live 12 demo project to Live 11.
